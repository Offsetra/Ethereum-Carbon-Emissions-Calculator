The total emissions are derived from the amount of `gas` used for each transaction.

## Developers

The emission table needs periodic updating until Ethereum goes carbon neutral.
Download .csv gas used data from https://etherscan.io/chart/gasused and hashrate data from https://etherscan.io/chart/hashrate

To generate up-to-date emission data:

1. Install Node v18 or higher
1. `npm run update-emissions-data`
